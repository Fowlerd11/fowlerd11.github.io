            <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
            
            <hr>
            
            <p>Who am I? Well, I’m a music lover and a techy. I've aspired to go into the field of technology since I was a young boy. I always played video games, starting from a PlayStation 1 way back when, to playing just about any/every system on the market now. My whole life has been influenced in some way by video games and the advancement of technology. Playing different games, I learned to grow a great respect for the developers and designers, as making a game is no easy task. When I was a kid, I would play a game and say, "Wow, this game is cool. I like it." Now when I play a game, I think of more in-depth stuff like: animations, graphics, fluidity, playability, genre, length, plot, design of the UI, and so on.</p>
            
            <p>Making apps/games/websites has been on my mind for years, which is why I’ve begun pursuing the IT field as a career. I do a lot of tech projects with my friend, Samuel Steele, who's a great developer. We work on websites and applications and designs together, and we've proven to be a really good team. We hope to possibly bring our talents to a higher level someday and make it a full time job. It's a little difficult at my age, due to school and my job, but I’ve been excelling in school and used Careerline Tech Center to integrate more technology into my normal school life.</p>
            
            <p>Music has also become a big part of my life. I enjoy pretty much any type of music, and I play drums to rock/metal music. I’ve been learning how to use FL Studio to create Electronic Dance Music (EDM), and hopefully I’ll DJ as a side job or a hobby someday. There’s almost never a time where I’m not listening to music or playing a song in my head. One of my biggest inspirations, Serj Tankian (System of a Down), was a software developer in the 90s and left his own business to form one of the most popular metal bands of all time. I may not want to leave the IT business completely, but maybe one day I’ll find a good middle ground where I can do both music and tech.</p>
